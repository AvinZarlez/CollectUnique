Collect Unique
------------------------------

Created by Tobiah Marks/PlayPerro in 4 hours on August 24th, 2013 for the CoronaBlitz coding challenge.

Project theme: Collection.

Design thoughts:
I wanted to aim simple, so I could wrap up the bulk of the game in an hour or two and then playtest/tweak for the remaining time. I decided to go with a pattern matching game. You are presented with a series of shapes+colors, and the goal is to correctly remember if this pattern is unique or you've already seen it.

For example, say at first you see a red square and then a blue circle, hitting "Unique" on each one, then when you see another red square you have to hit "Repeat" instead.

You gain 100 points plus 50 per combo/correct streak.

How I tackled the challenge:
I completed the challenge in two sessions. In the first two hours I got the bulk of the game done, then after an hour break I adding features and polished for the remaining time. This allowed me some time to think about the design and code in my head, and figure out what my next step would be. Although it did feel a bit like cheating, but I believe I was in the spirit of the competition as I was only developing the game for four hours. Having the break inbetween I think helped a lot.

What I think worked:
The design was simple, and I quickly had a "game" working, which let me get in scoring and menus. I also added menu options on the front screen to tweak the gameplay, such as how many colors/shapes there are or how long you have to answer. This allows for various skill level and play balance without needing to waste time playtesting and fine tuning the game.

Mistakes made:
I spent too much time worrying about details that don't matter, like the placement of text. I think I could have aimed to get more features in the game, but I chose instead to make it more readible. I think the spirit of this is to challenge what you can do, not to make something releaseable in 4 hours.
